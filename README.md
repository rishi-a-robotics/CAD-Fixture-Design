# CAD Fixture Design for Robotic Processing

## Project Overview
This project involved the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and 3D printing of a specialized fixture. [cite_start]The primary goal was to create a fixture that could securely hold a cylindrical object, preventing its rotation, while it undergoes processing by a robot[cite: 23, 24, 26]. [cite_start]The design prioritizes easy insertion and removal of the cylinder[cite: 24, 28].

## Design and Fabrication
[cite_start]The fixture was designed in SolidWorks, incorporating a locking mechanism to ensure stability[cite: 32, 37, 38]. [cite_start]PLA (polylactic acid) was selected as the material for 3D printing due to its suitability for the application, balancing affordability, ease of printing, and sufficient strength[cite: 39]. [cite_start]The project included conceptualization, iterative prototyping, and quality control during fabrication[cite: 31, 34, 41].

## Key Deliverables
* 3D CAD models of the fixture.
* Dimensional diagrams (Front, Top, Right views).
* [cite_start]A physical 3D printed prototype[cite: 79].
